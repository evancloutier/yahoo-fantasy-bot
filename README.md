# A Facebook Messenger Bot for Yahoo! Fantasy Sports

Easily get updates and manage your Yahoo! Fantasy Sports teams via Facebook Messenger.

There are a few simple actions you can do with it including checking your lineup, matchup, player stats, and league standings. Support for multiple leagues across an account is built in as well.

In the future, I'm hoping to implement an autoset feature so that the bot will manage your lineup for you by moving players from the bench to the active roster.
